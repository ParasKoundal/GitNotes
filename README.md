# GitNotes Extension

**Context-aware notes for your GitHub repositories.**

GitNotes is a Chrome Extension that allows you to take notes specifically for the GitHub repository you are currently viewing. It opens as a side panel, giving you a seamless note-taking experience right next to your code.

## Features

-   **Context-Aware**: Automatically detects the GitHub repo you are on (e.g., `facebook/react`) and filters your notes to show only those relevant to that repo.
-   **Side Panel**: Opens in the Chrome Side Panel for a non-intrusive workflow.
-   **Rich Text & Markdown**: Supports code blocks, links, and basic formatting.
-   **Local Storage**: All data is stored locally on your machine for privacy and speed.
-   **Version History**: Keep track of changes with a built-in history and diff viewer.
-   **Dark Mode**: Automatically respects your system's theme preferences.

## Installation

Since GitNotes is currently in development, you can install it manually:

1.  **Download/Clone** this repository to your local machine.
2.  Open Google Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions`.
3.  Enable **Developer mode** by toggling the switch in the top right corner.
4.  Click the **Load unpacked** button.
5.  Select the `GitNotes` folder from the downloaded files.
6.  The extension is now installed! Pin it to your toolbar for easy access.
